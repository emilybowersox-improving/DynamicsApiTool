# Configuration

Create a file called `dynamics-config.json` in the web project. This file is not in source control on purpose, so please don't add it. The values you'll need to put are as follows, though you'll use whatever is appropriate for your tenant. If your configuration worked last week, it should work this week with this project.

```
{
  "TenantId": "45*****2b",
  "ClientId": "cf*****7e",
  "ClientSecret": "a4*****x_",
  "TenantUrl": "https://org*****.api.crm.dynamics.com"
}
```
